# 🛡️ Privacy Policy: 3Dino Chrome Extension

**Effective Date:** April 22, 2025

---

### 🔍 What the Extension Does

The **3Dino** Chrome Extension monitors your browser's internet connection status (online/offline) for a single purpose:

> **To launch an offline 3D dinosaur game when internet connectivity is lost.**

No other data is monitored, accessed, or processed.

---

### 📡 What Information Is Collected?

**Nothing.**

- ❌ We do **not** collect personal information  
- ❌ We do **not** store your browsing history, activity, or usage  
- ❌ We do **not** access or track what tabs you visit  
- ❌ We do **not** use cookies or persistent storage

The extension simply listens for your browser's built-in `navigator.onLine` signal.

---

### 🧠 Why Internet Status Is Monitored

The extension needs to know when your connection is lost so it can:
- Launch the 3D dino game in a new tab (just like Chrome's original)
- Provide a lighthearted offline experience instead of a blank error page

This logic happens entirely inside your browser. It does not require external servers or analytics.

---

### 🔒 Data Sharing and Selling

- ❌ **We do not share or sell your data** — because we don’t collect any in the first place.
- ❌ No data is transmitted off your device.

---

### 📦 Remote Code and Permissions

This extension:
- ✅ Does **not** load any remote scripts or code
- ✅ Bundles all logic, models, and fonts directly within the extension
- ✅ Does **not** communicate with external servers at any time

---

### 📬 Contact

If you have questions or concerns, please reach out via the contact email listed on the Chrome Web Store listing.
