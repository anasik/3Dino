# 🦖 3Dino – Chrome Extension

- A 3D version of Chrome's Dinosaur Game powered by Three.js. 
- Automatically launches in a new tab when internet disconnects and closes when it reconnects.
- Ideally, I wanted to replace the existing game altogether but so far I've been unable to do that. Let me know if you have ideas. 

## 📦 Features

- Runs completely offline
- Smooth 3D animation and gameplay
- Spawns obstacles over time (cacti, pterodactyls)
- Auto-opens when internet drops, closes or pauses on reconnect
- Built with Vite and bundled as a Chrome Extension
